# eslint-config for typescript

I use this configuration for my personal projects that are built with different frameworks. The configuration is quite strict, so you may want to disable some rules in your project.

## Installation


1.  ```bash
    npm i -D @chernodub/eslint-config
    ```
2.  Add `@chernodub/eslint-config` to `extends` of your eslint config (or `overrides` section)


## Development

* Very useful tool for querying AST via [no-restricted-syntax](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-restricted-syntax) - https://astexplorer.net/
